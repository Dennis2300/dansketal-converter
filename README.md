# Number To Text Converter in C

This is a simple C program that converts numbers to text format. <br>
The program features a text-based interface and is structured with separate files for the main logic and conversion functions.

- The code has been written with seperation of concerns by using `.c` and `.h`files.
- Includes my personal notes on most lines of code as notes and explanation for myself. And I hope for you aswell.
- The program is done with a do-while loop so to exit the program you have to press ```ctrl + c``` to exit the program.
